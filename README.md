**Crop nitrogen monitoring**

**Aim**
To simulate the leaf optical properties (reflectance and transmittance) across the visible to shortwave infrared (400–2500 nm) spectral region.
To retrieve biochemical and biophysical parameters of leaves from their spectral reflectance and transmittance data.

**Principle**
Based on radiative transfer theory, specifically the plate model (a leaf is modeled as a stack of elementary layers).
It uses the leaf structure parameter (N) and biochemical constituents (chlorophyll, carotenoids, water, dry matter, etc.) to describe light interactions (absorption, scattering, transmission).
Assumes homogeneous distribution of leaf components in the layers.

**Objective**
To estimate leaf biochemical properties (Chlorophyll a+b content, carotenoids, equivalent water thickness, leaf dry matter content).
To simulate leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra for vegetation monitoring and precision agriculture.
To support inversion techniques for retrieving vegetation traits from hyperspectral data.
